## About the Project
BlindSight is an Android application currently under design and prototyping intended to be used as a navigation aid for blind people. Specifically the project aims to utilize an indoor positioning system for indoor navigation and a camera for object detection and collision avoidance. The app will use audio feedback to warn the user of collisions and avert them from the objects. The collaboration service being used for the project is [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LYItQNqnYhe0bkE86SYwlCVEKCbbqJdP?usp=sharing)
